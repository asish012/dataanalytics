## Common Graphs
- Bar chart and Pie charts:               For categorical data.  
- Histograms, Box plots and Time plots:   For quantative data.  
- Scatter plot:                           To examine the relationship between a pair of quantitative variables.  

- **Bar chart** (categorical data):  
  Each bar represents a category and the hight of the bar represents the count or percentage of each category.
  Types of bar charts:
  - Pareto chart
  - Vertical bar chart
  - Stacked bar chart
- **Pie chart** (categorical data):  
  Pie chart uses pie slices to represent the percentage share of different categories. It is similar to a bar graph, but emphasizes each category as a part of one whole. In other words when we used pie chart we implicit and assumed that the category is exhaustive.
- **Histograms** (quantative data):  
  A histogram is a summary plot for a single numerical variable. It shows a distribution of the data giving some sense on basic characteristics of the data. Including center variability, skewness, modality, outliers, and possibly other patterns.  
  Even though histograms can only show one variable at a time, side by side histograms can be used to compare distribution of multiple variables.  
  When constructing histograms, it is important to choose appropriate beam widths, or the widths of the individual bars. If small pinwheels is used, the graph can show too much detail, and be hard to read. However, using large pinwheels can lead to misleading patterns and give the wrong real impression.  
- **Box plot** (quantative data):  
  The box plot effectively divides the data into four quarters, and clearly marks their boundaries.  
  Box plot shows five summary statistics:  
  - minimum
  - first quartile
  - second quartile (median)
  - third quartile
  - maximum  
  The outliers are represented by the dots in the graph.  
  Side by side box plots are very effective in showing differences in a quantitative variable, across factor levels.
- **Time plot** (quantative data):  
  Time plot can be used when there is a meaningful sequence such as time.
- **Scatter plot** (relationship between two unrelated variables):  
  Typically, the exploratory or independent variable is plotted on the x-axis. And response or dependent variable is plotted on the y-axis. Each pair of data appear as a point in plot.  

# Data visualization Good Practices
- Sometimes using few data results most value:
  Maintain visual correspondence to quantity, and beware of starting a scale at a non-zero value. Sometimes starting the y-axis at zero offers better visibility sometimes they does not.  
  Imagine a sales comparison over the month's, where sales quantity are in between 20000 and 25000. If we start the y-axis at zero, we won't even notice the difference from the plot/dot chart. We can also start the y-axis from 15000 and go up to 25000. Then the difference over the months will be better visible. Which approach is right depends on the business and requirements. To some business the difference might be negligible to some business its not.
- Avoid pie charts:  
  Both pie charts and a bar graph can be used to chart categorical data. While pie charts are widely used, Few warns us to avoid pie charts. Their main point is that it is difficult to maintain correlation between pie slice and the quantity it represents. As a result, it forces to us interpret and compare pie slices which can be difficult for many people. In the comparing the values of bars is relatively easy on a bar graph.
- For time series data, we should not use points. We should use bars to emphasize individual values and lines to emphasize trend.
- Avoid 3D and other gimmicks when constructing graphs because they do not help our understanding of the data. They add more ink without adding more data.
