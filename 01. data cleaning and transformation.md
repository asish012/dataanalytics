# Data Cleanup and Transformation

## Ask before cleaning data:
- Do character variables have valid values?
- Are numeric variables within range?
- Are there missing values?
- Are there duplicated values?
- Are values unique for some variables, for example, ID variables?
- Are the dates valid?
- Do we need to combine multiple data files?

It is important to check those questions and handle them appropriately in the data cleanup process.

Handling missing values usually requires good understanding of the problem context and can take many alternative approaches.
Data cleaning open source tools are **OpenRefine** and **Data Wrangler**.

## Transformations
The most common data transformations are **centering** and **scaling** of a single variable.
In statistics, it is calculating the z-score of each observed value. Which is, each data value is first reduced by the mean and then divided by the standard deviation.
Benefits of centering and scaling is to make numerical procedures easier to work with and more stable.
Centering and scaling is often required or recommended for some modeling tools, such as clustering, principal component analysis, and neural networks.

## Dealing with missing values
- Remove the data
- Impute/estimate a value
  - With Zero
  - With average
  - With similar data points ("interpolation"): previous week's/year's datapoint
  - With "missing" as a category for categorical data

## Dealing with outliers
Ask:
- Is the outlier a mistake or a legitimate point?
- Is the outlier part of the population of interest?

We need to identify, if we should include the outlier datapoint in our analysis?
Possible outcome:
- Correct the outlier datapoint
- Remove the entire data
- Data transformation
- Treat as missing data

## Adding and Removing Variables [Dummy variables]
- **ADD**: Categorical variables can be transformed into multiple variables. When transforming categorical variable into multiple dummy variables, the maximum number of dummy variables can be: #categories - 1
- **Remove**: Sometimes multiple variables contain the same information.
